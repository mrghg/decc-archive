If the DECC network data are essential to the work, co-authorship on publications may be appropriate.",
    "data_reciprocity_agreement": "Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate. Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their own data available to the general public and to the scientific community in an equally complete and easily accessible form. Scientists are encouraged to make available to the community, upon request, their own modelling tools used in the interpretation of the DECC Network data, namely well documented model code, transport fields, and additional information necessary for other scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions."
